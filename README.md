# stamp-selling

This repository contains my first Python project. It was completed through a postgraduate unit as an individual task, where I was just introduced to Python programming. The assignment involved programming a complete stamp selling app, where we had to read and write to CSV files of all sorts, and include different modules for each function of the app.

'stamp_selling.py' is the main python script, and is to be run first.
